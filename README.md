commonly used Operating system(OS) are:

   **WINDOWS**
   
   **MACos**
   
   **LINUX**
  
2.**BARE METAL**
 
Bare metal‚Äù refers to a computing environment where software runs directly on the hardware without any intermediary layers such as a traditional operating system. 
 
3.**CISC(COMPLEX INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER)**

CISC is a type of computer architecture that uses a rich set of instructions, where each instruction can perform multiple low-level operations (such as arithmetic, memory access, or logic operations) in a single instruction cycle.

Example:
x86 Architecture: A widely used CISC architecture found in most personal computers.

4.**RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**

RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of CPU architecture designed to simplify instruction execution and improve performance by focusing on a smaller, more efficient set of instructions.

Examples of RISC Architectures:

ARM (Advanced RISC Machine): Widely used in mobile devices, tablets, and increasingly in other computing environments due to its power efficiency and performance.

MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages): Commonly used in academic settings, embedded systems, and some consumer electronics.

PowerPC: Used in older Apple Macintosh computers, some game consoles, and embedded applications.
