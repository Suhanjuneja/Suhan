# KEYWORDS
1.**operating system**

An operating system (OS) is a crucial software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

commonly used Operating system(OS) are:

   **WINDOWS**
   
   **MACos**
   
   **LINUX**
  
2.**BARE METAL**
 
Bare metal” refers to a computing environment where software runs directly on the hardware without any intermediary layers such as a traditional operating system. 
 
3.**CISC(COMPLEX INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER)**

CISC is a type of computer architecture that uses a rich set of instructions, where each instruction can perform multiple low-level operations (such as arithmetic, memory access, or logic operations) in a single instruction cycle.

Example:
x86 Architecture: A widely used CISC architecture found in most personal computers.

4.**RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**

RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of CPU architecture designed to simplify instruction execution and improve performance by focusing on a smaller, more efficient set of instructions.

Examples of RISC Architectures:

ARM (Advanced RISC Machine): Widely used in mobile devices, tablets, and increasingly in other computing environments due to its power efficiency and performance.

MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages): Commonly used in academic settings, embedded systems, and some consumer electronics.

PowerPC: Used in older Apple Macintosh computers, some game consoles, and embedded applications.

5.**RISC-v**

RISC-V (pronounced “RISC-five”) is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer). It was designed to be simple, modular, and extensible. 

Examples of RISC-V Implementations:

SiFive: A company that offers RISC-V processors and development boards.

Western Digital: Uses RISC-V cores in some of its storage devices.

Microchip: Provides RISC-V-based microcontrollers for various applications.

6.**KERNEL**

The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages hardware resources, handles system calls, and facilitates communication between hardware and software. It controls processes, memory, device drivers, and file systems, providing essential services and ensuring efficient system operation.

7.**LINUX**

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that forms the basis for various operating systems (distributions). It manages hardware resources and provides a platform for running applications. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.

broad categorization of Linux distributions:

1. **Debian-Based Distributions**
 
1.Debian: Known for its stability and extensive software repositories. Often used as a base for other distributions.
Ubuntu: One of the most popular desktop Linux distributions, known for its user-friendliness and strong community support. It has several variants, including Ubuntu Server, Kubuntu, and Xubuntu.
Linux Mint: Based on Ubuntu, it provides a more traditional desktop environment and is known for its ease of use.
Raspberry Pi OS: Formerly Raspbian, optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware.

2.**Red Hat-Based Distributions**

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): A commercial distribution focused on enterprise environments, with a strong emphasis on stability and support.
CentOS: Originally a free and open-source alternative to RHEL, CentOS Stream now serves as a rolling-release variant that tracks just ahead of RHEL.
Fedora: A cutting-edge distribution that showcases the latest in Linux technology, often serving as a proving ground for features that may later be included in RHEL.

8.**NETWORK**

 A network refers to a system of interconnected computers and other devices that can communicate with each other and share resources. Networks can vary in size, complexity, and purpose.
 There are two types of network-

 1.**INTERNET**[(WAN-wide area network)and it is a public network]

 2.**INTRANET**[(LAN-LOCAL AREA NETWORK)and it is a private network]

9. **IP ADRESS**[INTERNET PROTOCOL]

 IP stands for Internet Protocol, which is a fundamental protocol used for communicating data across networks. It is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, which is the set of protocols used to manage network communications.
 
There are two main types of IP addresses:

IPv4: This is the most common format and looks like four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It has a limited number of possible addresses.

IPv6: This is a newer format designed to address the limitations of IPv4, featuring a much larger address space. It consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

10.**FRONT END**

"Front end" refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It encompasses everything that users see and engage with on the screen.
