 1.**INTERNET**[(WAN-wide area network)and it is a public network]

 2.**INTRANET**[(LAN-LOCAL AREA NETWORK)and it is a private network]

9. **IP ADRESS**[INTERNET PROTOCOL]

 IP stands for Internet Protocol, which is a fundamental protocol used for communicating data across networks. It is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, which is the set of protocols used to manage network communications.
 
There are two main types of IP addresses:

IPv4: This is the most common format and looks like four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It has a limited number of possible addresses.

IPv6: This is a newer format designed to address the limitations of IPv4, featuring a much larger address space. It consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

10.**FRONT END**

"Front end" refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It encompasses everything that users see and engage with on the screen.

Key Components of Front-End Development:

TML (HyperText Markup Language): The fundamental building block of web pages, HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the visual appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

JavaScript: This programming language adds interactivity to web pages. It enables dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and more.

11.**BACK END**

Back-end development focuses on the server side of a web application or website. It involves everything that happens on the server and is not visible to users directly. This includes the logic, database interactions, authentication, and server configuration.

Key Components of Back-End Development:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The fundamental building block of web pages, HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage.

JavaScript: This programming language adds interactivity to web pages. It enables dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and more.

12.**DEVOPS**

DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies aimed at improving collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. The goal of DevOps is to streamline the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and enhance the ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. This involves integrating and automating the processes involved in software development, deployment, and operations.

13.**VPN(Virtual Private Network)**

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. VPNs are used to protect data privacy, enhance security, and provide anonymity while browsing online. Here’s a deeper look at what VPNs are and how they work

14.**DBMS(DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)**

A DBMS (Database Management System) is software that facilitates the creation, management, and manipulation of databases. It acts as an intermediary between users and the database, allowing for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. 

15.**BLOCK CHAIN**

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that ensures the integrity and security of digital transactions and data. It is most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, but its applications extend far beyond that. 

16.**FIREWALL**

A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors, filters, and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary purpose is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network (such as a company's internal network) and untrusted external networks (such as the internet), thereby protecting the internal network from unauthorized access, attacks, and other security threats.

Types of Firewalls:

**Network Firewalls**:

17.**VIRTUAL MACHINE**

A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine but is hosted on a physical computer known as a "host" machine. VMs allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine simultaneously, providing flexibility, scalability, and isolation for various computing tasks.

Key Concepts of Virtual Machines:

**Host Machine:** The physical computer that provides the resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) for the virtual machines. It runs a hypervisor to manage and allocate resources to VMs.

**Guest Machine**: The virtualized environment that runs its own operating system and applications. Each VM is a guest machine, isolated from other VMs on the same host.

**Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor):** Software that creates and manages virtual machines by abstracting and allocating the host machine’s resources. There are two types of hypervisors:

**Type 1 Hypervisor:** Runs directly on the host's hardware and is often referred to as a "bare-metal" hypervisor. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

**Type 2 Hypervisor:** Runs on top of a conventional operating system. It is also known as a "hosted" hypervisor. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

**Virtualization:** The process of creating virtual versions of physical resources, such as servers, storage devices, and network resources. Virtualization enables multiple VMs to share the same physical resources efficiently.

**Snapshot:** A saved state of a VM at a specific point in time. Snapshots allow you to revert a VM to a previous state if needed.

**Cloning:** Creating an identical copy of a VM. Cloning is useful for deploying multiple instances of the same VM configuration.

**Isolation:** Each VM operates independently, with its own operating system and applications. This isolation ensures that issues or failures in one VM do not affect others on the same host.

18.**SEMI-CONDUCTERS**

A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Semiconductors are essential to modern electronics because they can be engineered to control electrical current in various ways, making them fundamental to the operation of electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and many other digital gadgets.
