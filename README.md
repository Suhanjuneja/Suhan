# KEYWORDS
1.**operating system**

An operating system (OS) is a crucial software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

commonly used Operating system(OS) are:

   **WINDOWS**
   
   **MACos**
   
   **LINUX**
  
2.**BARE METAL**
 
Bare metal” refers to a computing environment where software runs directly on the hardware without any intermediary layers such as a traditional operating system. 
 
3.**CISC(COMPLEX INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER)**

CISC is a type of computer architecture that uses a rich set of instructions, where each instruction can perform multiple low-level operations (such as arithmetic, memory access, or logic operations) in a single instruction cycle.

Example:
x86 Architecture: A widely used CISC architecture found in most personal computers.

4.**RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**

RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of CPU architecture designed to simplify instruction execution and improve performance by focusing on a smaller, more efficient set of instructions.

Examples of RISC Architectures:

ARM (Advanced RISC Machine): Widely used in mobile devices, tablets, and increasingly in other computing environments due to its power efficiency and performance.

MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages): Commonly used in academic settings, embedded systems, and some consumer electronics.

PowerPC: Used in older Apple Macintosh computers, some game consoles, and embedded applications.

5.**RISC-v**

RISC-V (pronounced “RISC-five”) is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer). It was designed to be simple, modular, and extensible. 

Examples of RISC-V Implementations:

SiFive: A company that offers RISC-V processors and development boards.

Western Digital: Uses RISC-V cores in some of its storage devices.

Microchip: Provides RISC-V-based microcontrollers for various applications.

6.**KERNEL**

The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages hardware resources, handles system calls, and facilitates communication between hardware and software. It controls processes, memory, device drivers, and file systems, providing essential services and ensuring efficient system operation.

7.**LINUX**

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that forms the basis for various operating systems (distributions). It manages hardware resources and provides a platform for running applications. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.
